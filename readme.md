# accurateping

transaction based ping, the way it SHOULD be done in mc

## incompatibilities

- lynx anticheat (sorry cyanade)
  - it's not really "incompatible" per se, but lynx will occasionally (every few hours) kick players for incorrectly responding to transactions
- vulcan anticheat
  - occasional "bad packets" flags
- other anticheats (untested)
